# GENERATORS/////////////////

# GENERATORS ARE ITERATORS 
# GENERATORS ARE GIVE A SEQUENCE LIKE LIST , BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN LIST AND GENERATORS 
# WHEN WE USE LIST TO PRINT ANY DATA OR SEQUENCE THEN THE ALL DATA(ALL ELEMENTS OF LIST) IS STORE IN MEMORY PERMANANTLY
# BUT IN GENERATORS WHEN WE USR ANY DATA OR SEQUENCE TO PRINT THEN ONLY ONE ELEMENT STORE IN MEMORY AND WHEN NEXT ELEMENT IS COME TO PRINT THEN THE PREVIOUS ELEMENT IS AUTOMATICALLY DELETE IN MEMORY.
# LIST TAKE MORE MEMORY AND TIME
# GENERATORS TAKE LESS MEMORY AND TIME
# LIST ARE USE WHEN WE HAVE TO USE OUR DATA MANY TIMES 
# GENERATORS ARE USE WHEN WE HAVE TO USE OUR DATA JUST ONE TIME .
